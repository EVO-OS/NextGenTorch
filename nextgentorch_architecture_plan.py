# NextGenTorch Architecture Plan

This document outlines the proposed architecture for the NextGenTorch model, which combines elements from Gemma, Phi3, Grok, and Google DeepMind Gemma models, using the NextGenJax library as the primary framework.

## Core Components:
- NextGenJax library (version 0.2.0) as the primary framework for model development.
- Model parameters to support: 1b, 2b, 7b, 16b, 32b, 64b, and 128b configurations.

## Model Architecture:
- Text-to-text, decoder-only architecture inspired by the Gemma model.
- Efficiency and small size optimizations from the Phi3 model.
- Advanced reasoning and extended context length capabilities from the Grok model.
- Integration with Google DeepMind Gemma's advanced features where applicable.

## Features from NextGenJax:
- Utilization of NextGenJax's tokenization and preprocessing utilities.
- Leverage NextGenJax's model training and evaluation pipelines.
- Incorporate NextGenJax's support for both TensorFlow and PyTorch backends.

## Folder Structure:
- The folder structure will be similar to the Gemma PyTorch implementation, with modifications to accommodate NextGenJax components.

## Integration with Other Components:
- Fairscale for distributed training support.
- Langchain for natural language processing and chaining capabilities.

## Development Plan:
1. Set up the basic folder structure and initialize the Python packages.
2. Develop the core model classes and functions, ensuring compatibility with NextGenJax.
3. Integrate tokenization and preprocessing features from NextGenJax.
4. Implement model parameter configurations for the various sizes.
5. Incorporate elements from Gemma, Phi3, and Grok models.
6. Test the integration with Fairscale and Langchain.
7. Develop a comprehensive testing suite to ensure model performance and stability.
8. Document the model architecture, usage, and integration steps.

This plan is subject to review and approval by the project stakeholders.
